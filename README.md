# INFO 340 Project: Waves

We are hoping to set up a website that creates a community of music enthusiasts, allowing users to communicate with their friends online, make new connections, and share their playlists or own music! We want to **connect musicians based on their geographic location, demographics, and musical interests**.

Although there are already many music apps in this space, they aren’t focused on making genuine connections like we are:

- Spotify allows users to play music as well as allowing users to add friends and view their listening activity. But it lacks the ability to communicate with each other on the platform.
- Drooble is focused on posting and critiquing each other’s music. However, provides little functionality for casual music enthusiasts who want to comment on music not posted by the site’s users.
- Twitter is a social network where users can post, but it’s too broad and doesn’t have a focus on music.
We believe we can combine the best features of these existing sites together to create a better music social platform.
