            <h1>Our Goal</h1>
            <p>
                We are hoping to set up a website that creates a community of music enthusiasts, 
                allowing users to communicate with their friends online, make new connections, 
                and share their playlists or own music! We want to <strong>connect musicians based on their 
                geographic location, demographics, and musical interests.</strong>
            </p> 
            <p>
                Although there are already many music apps in this space, they aren’t focused on making genuine connections 
                like we are: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/" target="_blank">Spotify</a> 
                            allows users to play music as well as allowing users to 
                            add friends and view their listening activity. But it lacks the ability to communicate 
                            with each other on the platform. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://drooble.com/" target="_blank">Drooble</a> 
                        is focused on posting and critiquing each 
                        other’s music. However, provides little functionality for casual music enthusiasts 
                        who want to comment on music not posted by the site’s users. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://twitter.com/?lang=en" target="_blank">Twitter</a> is a social 
                        network where users can post, but it’s too broad and doesn’t have a focus on music.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                We believe we can combine the best features of these existing sites together to create 
                a better music social platform.

            <h1>Features</h1>
            <p>Our app is geared towards music enthusiasts ranging from causal listeners to professional musicians. </p>
            <p>Here are some things users will be able to do on our app:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Our users will be able to <strong>make a profile, add songs that they like (or create on their own) 
                    into playlists, and share them with others</strong>. Making a profile will consist of adding a personal 
                    or user name, gender, pronouns, and tag musical interests. Users may also opt to sign in 
                    through Google using 
                    <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in" target="_blank">their API</a>. 
                    We want users to be able to link their Spotify, Apple Music, 
                    or SoundCloud profiles since many users probably also use these apps. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Furthermore, users will be able to make <strong>posts on songs they are currently listening to</strong>, connect 
                    with other users with similar interests, add each other as friends, and continue chatting. 
                    Users will also be able to search for specific profiles and add them as friends. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    We also want to have a <strong>list of top user songs of the week, month, and year over different genres.</strong> 
                    This way we can build a sense of community by allowing users to listen to these songs and comment 
                    on each of these top songs to discuss what they like and dislike about them. This also allows 
                    users to explore new music and connect with other users. We can also create this list by using 
                    <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/" target="_blank">Spotify</a> or
                    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi/" target="_blank">Apple Music’s</a> 
                    API to get top songs as well. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>That is our overall idea for the project proposal. Thank you for your reading!</p>
